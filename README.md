## **6.15 CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile Project**

### Overview
For this challenge, I have created a simpler version of the Instagram desktop page where various CSS was used such as flexbox, grid, animations, hover and lots more CSS concepts. Most of the elements on this webpage are supposed to be similar to that of the Instagram desktop page, however a few of the code put into this challenge does not look exactly like the web page. The grids and flexboxes as well as some manually inputed code are there for ease of access across multiple devices such as mobile phones and desktop.

### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery

- **CSS Layout Techniques**: I have used flexboxes and grids in order to get the layout to look appealing and to add the decor for the HTML structure.
- **Responsive Design**: I was not able to use media queries, however I had added the auto fit grid into the webpage so that it be accessible on most devices.
- **Styling Elements**: I've styled each item in order to represent the Instagram webpage, which includes the edit profile button, settings button, the profile picture and added a dotted border around it as a similar look as an Instragram story to view and added a hover animation for the posts in order to show the likes and comments, I was not able to get it to look exactly like the instragram website, however it does have its functionality. 

#### Challenges Faced

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**: I was not able to successfully implement media queries into the code for compatibilty for other devices as the text and images does look a bit cramped, however the auto fit grid does make it a bit easier to use.
- **Hover and Focus Effects**: I've researched on how to add a hover effect similar to instragram, however I could not perfect it to look exactly like the original and had to make do with what control I had over the styling.

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Advanced CSS Properties**: I'd like to learn more about media queries and how to efficiently use flexboxes as well as grids in order to reduce the amount of code and take less time with ironing out the fine prints in these concepts as I faced a lot of challenges trying to get it to how I wanted it to look.
- **Code Optimization**: I do believe that some of my code is redundant, where there are some short-hands I could have used to reduce the amount of code. I wish to work on that so that I can have cleaner and more efficient code.
- **Creative Design Choices**:  I went for a similar layout to Instagram, but due to the complexity of the challenge and the nature of my knowledge at this present moment in time, my imagination was too powerful for my level of skill at the moment and the desired outcome was not achieved in terms of design and styling, however I am satisfactory with the current design for now as it does represent a part of instagrams layout.

#### Overall Learning Experience
This challenge and course content was quite challenging as there were lots of topics and advanced concepts that were covered. Due to the nature of work-life-code balance it was a lot to take in and a lot of late hours at night trying to keep up with the pace of learning. However, a great man once said you have to push through it all in order to come out the victor.
